## Tkinter Application

A beginner-friendly Python GUI application built using the **Tkinter** module. This was my first experiment with desktop GUI development in Python. The app demonstrates basic window creation, widget placement, and event handling.

### 🚀 Features

* Simple graphical user interface (GUI)
* Demonstrates usage of Buttons, Labels, Entry fields, and Frames
* Basic layout management with `pack` and `grid`
* Event-driven programming (button clicks and user input)
* Clear separation of UI code and application logic

---

### 📝 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally.

#### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher installed
* Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sobhan661/Tkinter-Application.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Tkinter-Application
   ```

### ▶️ How to Run

1. Open a terminal and ensure you are in the project directory.
2. Run the main application script:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. The GUI window will appear. Interact with the buttons and input fields as shown.

### 💡 How It Works

* **Main Window**: Created using `Tk()` from the `tkinter` module.
* **Widgets**:

  * `Label` to display text
  * `Entry` for user input
  * `Button` to trigger actions
* **Layout Management**:

  * `pack()` method for simple stacking
  * `grid()` method for more precise placement
* **Event Handling**:

  * Button commands bound to handler functions
  * Reading and processing user input from `Entry` fields

### ✨ Technologies Used

* **Python**: Core language
* **Tkinter**: Standard library module for GUI development
